# 👋 Hi, I’m @Thanhlearningcode

- 👀 I’m interested in Embedded Systems and Mechatronics Engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Autosar Architecture, MBD concepts, and STM32 microcontroller programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to embedded systems, smart home technologies, and innovative solutions in smart parking.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once designed a smart home system as part of a PBL project and am now diving deep into robotics and image processing! Additionally, I have explored low-level programming for STM32 microcontrollers, including using register libraries and writing assembly code to optimize performance.

## STM32 Microcontrollers

### STM32F103
- **CMSIS:** Device-specific headers and startup code are available from STMicroelectronics or STM32CubeMX.
- **Standard Peripheral Library (SPL):** Provides functions for peripheral control, though now deprecated.
- **HAL Library:** For abstraction and simplification, use the STM32F1 HAL libraries from STM32CubeMX.

### STM32F411
- **CMSIS:** Provides the necessary headers and startup code for STM32F411.
- **HAL Library:** Utilize STM32CubeF4 firmware package, including tailored HAL libraries.
- **Assembly Language Programming:** Write assembly code in `.s` or `.asm` files for low-level operations and integrate with your project build system.

Feel free to explore these resources and tools for more in-depth information and support with your projects!
